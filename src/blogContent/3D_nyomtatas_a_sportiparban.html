<p class="font18">
Sports often lead in adopting new tech to boost performance and experience. 3D printing has emerged as
an especially promising technology for the sports industry.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Applications in sports</h2>
<p class="font18">
3D printing builds objects layer by layer, enabling complex forms difficult with traditional methods.
<br><br>
A primary use is custom equipment tailored to individual athletes — beyond mass‑produced sizes — to
improve fit and performance.
<br><br>
Examples: golf clubs with custom weighting and grip sizes; bike frames tuned to rider dimensions and
riding style.
<br><br>
Beyond gear, performance apparel with engineered structures (wicking, support) is explored.
<br><br>
Challenges include limited textile‑grade materials; this is improving with new polymers and lattice
structures.
<br><br>
Cost versus mass production is another factor; unit costs drop as technology matures.
<br><br>
Despite these challenges, the potential is significant. 3D printing enables personalized gear and performance apparel tailored to each athlete’s needs and preferences. As the tech matures and adoption grows, expect broader use across sports.

Sustainability: additive processes can cut material waste and enable local production, reducing
transport emissions.
<br><br>
Additive methods can be more sustainable: parts are built layer by layer using only needed material, cutting waste versus subtractive processes.
<br><br>
Local production can reduce long‑distance shipping and its footprint.
<br><br>
3D printing is also used for athlete prosthetics tailored to anatomy and sport‑specific needs.
<br><br>
3D printing also enables customized prosthetics designed for specific anatomy and sport demands — such as running blades tuned to an athlete’s build and gait — beyond what traditional methods can provide.

3D printing is impacting sports with custom equipment, performance wear, and prosthetics — enabling
designs impractical by traditional means.
