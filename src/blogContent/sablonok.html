<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">What are 3D‑printed stencils?</h2>
<p class="font18">
Stencils are a unique art form used on everything from warning signs to your favorite T‑shirt.
Traditionally they’re made industrially or customized with cutting tools and lasers, but there’s a
new method: 3D printing.<br><br>
Designing and printing your own stencils adds a personal touch. With 3D‑printed stencils you can
roll, brush, or spray your designs onto almost anything.<br><br>
One unique advantage is 3D‑printed bridges. Instead of typical stencil bridges that leave visible
gaps, printed bridges can span internal “islands” (like the center of an “O”) while letting paint
flow underneath — keeping the design intact without leftover tabs.<br><br>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Step 1: Create the image</h2>
<p class="font18">
Stencil graphics are straightforward. The stencil’s constraints guide how we create or edit the
image. Consider your print area, target resolution, whether you want a rigid or flexible stencil,
and the properties of the plastic you’ll use.<br><br>
Keep the end result in mind: early on, avoid overly detailed images or designs with too many
islands. Once your 2D artwork is ready, move on to the third dimension.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Step 2: Add the third dimension</h2>
<p class="font18">
Before extruding, decide the stencil thickness — this affects print time, stiffness, and strength.
Values between 0.4 mm and 1.2 mm work well.<br><br>
Leave enough border width to prevent paint bleed, and keep your printer’s build size in mind. As
noted, 3D bridges elevate stencil quality by eliminating traditional bridge gaps.<br><br>
Experiment freely, but keep the final use case in mind. Then export to STL and continue to the last
step: printing!<br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Step 3: Print your masterpiece</h2>
<p class="font18">
With very few layers, the first layer matters even more than usual. Level the bed carefully and
ensure good adhesion and a clean brim. If your bed grips too strongly, plan how to remove the
stencil without damage.<br><br>
If you don’t have a printer or prefer not to handle setup, you can outsource this to a printing
service.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Project ideas</h2>
<p class="font18">
Once your stencil is ready, try these ideas for inspiration:
</p>
<ul class="font18 dul">
  <li>Custom T‑shirts and apparel — apply your patterns anywhere</li>
  <li>Print coffee‑foam decoration stencils</li>
  <li>Make a series of mini‑stencils with various motifs</li>
  <li>Use inverse stencils to create stampers</li>
</ul>
