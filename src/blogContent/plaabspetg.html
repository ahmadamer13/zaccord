<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Key Differences</h2>
<p class="font18">
PLA, ABS, and PETG are among the most popular and accessible filaments — but each suits different tasks.<br><br>
PLA is easiest to print but not the strongest. ABS is often used when greater durability is needed. PETG is a popular choice when food safety matters and has great properties, though prints can string.<br><br>
This post examines pros and cons of each, compares print and material properties, and links to more detailed resources.<br><br>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">PLA</h2>
<p class="font18">
Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a plant‑based plastic typically derived from corn starch. As a thermoplastic from renewable feedstocks, it is fully or partially biodegradable. PLA is the most popular of the three materials.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Advantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
PLA is extremely easy to print, flows reliably without clogging, and uses relatively low printing temperatures compared to other filaments. It’s also inexpensive.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Disadvantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
PLA tends to deform or soften at higher temperatures, so it’s not ideal for heat‑resistant parts (e.g., a car dashboard on a hot day). It’s also more brittle than ABS or PETG, making it better for aesthetic than mechanical uses.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">ABS</h2>
<p class="font18">
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is an opaque thermoplastic common in household and consumer products. After PLA, it’s one of the most popular filaments. Beyond 3D printing, ABS is widely used in injection molding and machining.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Advantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
ABS is strong, tough, and durable with good heat and impact resistance. It tends to deform before breaking, making it good for frequently used items.<br><br>
It also finishes well: acetone smoothing can be used for post‑processing.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Disadvantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
ABS is sensitive to temperature changes, leading to warping and cracking during printing; an enclosure helps maintain temperatures. It’s also UV‑sensitive and can become brittle with exposure, so it’s not ideal for outdoor applications.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">PETG</h2>
<p class="font18">
Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is a thermoplastic whose properties make it well suited for functional objects. It’s commonly found in water bottles and food containers.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Advantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
PETG is generally considered food‑safe and can be used for items that contact food (kitchen accessories, camp tools, containers). With some temperature resistance, it may survive dishwashers. It’s also durable and highly impact‑resistant.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Disadvantages</h3>
<p class="font18">
Like ABS, PETG is UV‑sensitive, so it’s best for indoor uses. In strong UV it can become brittle and weak. PETG also tends to string during printing due to higher temperatures and free‑flowing filament. Another minor drawback: it scratches easily, which may be a deal‑breaker for some uses.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Comparisons</h2>
<p class="font18">
This section gives a quick side‑by‑side comparison of the three materials in printing and general properties.
</p>
<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Printing Temperature</h3>
<ul class="font18 dul">
  <li>PLA: 175-200 °C</li>
  <li>ABS: 230-250 °C</li>
  <li>PETG: 230-265 °C</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Post‑Processing</h3>
<ul class="font18 dul">
  <li>PLA: Sanding and primer are the primary finishing methods. There aren’t widely safe chemical smoothing options for PLA prints.</li>
  <li>ABS: ABS can be smoothed relatively easily with acetone; often that’s all that’s needed.</li>
  <li>PETG: Ethyl acetate can be used for smoothing PETG. Filling, sanding, and priming are proven methods that also work for PETG prints.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Strength and Durability</h3>
<ul class="font18 dul">
  <li>PLA is low‑to‑medium strength with low heat and chemical resistance; it can shatter on impact.</li>
  <li>ABS is medium‑to‑high strength, tends to bend before breaking, and has better impact/heat/chemical resistance than PLA.</li>
  <li>PETG is also medium‑to‑high strength, similar to ABS, often stronger especially when loads align with layer lines.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Best Use Cases</h2>
<ul class="font18 dul">
  <li>PLA: Best for applications without special functional requirements.</li>
  <li>ABS: Common for functional items used frequently or needing durability (e.g., drone frames).</li>
  <li>PETG: Good for items contacting food or drink; also suitable for functional parts.</li>
</ul>
