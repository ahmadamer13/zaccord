<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Introduction</h2>
<p class="font18">
  Learn the basics of layer height and how it affects printing. Layer height is a simple setting
  that impacts print speed, detail, durability, and overall appearance.
  <br><br>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">What is layer height and why it matters</h2>
    <p class="font18">
        Layer height is the exact thickness of each extruded or cured layer. You set it in your
        slicer, and it has a bigger effect on results than you might expect. Used well, it can
        improve speed, resolution, and smoothness.<br><br>
        Layer height is commonly measured in microns (1 micron = 0.001 mm). On FDM printers, smaller
        layers can improve XY precision for small moving features, such as print‑in‑place parts.<br><br>
        Different printers have different limits. Typical minimums are 50–100 microns (0.05–0.1 mm).
        <br><br>
        Now let’s see how to choose layer height for speed, resolution, and smoothness.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Optimizing print speed</h2>
<p class="font18">
        One common reason to change layer height is to speed up printing. Larger layers mean fewer
        layers to reach the same model height, so prints finish faster (and can cost less).
        <br><br>
        Generally, increasing layer height reduces resolution and surface quality. It’s best for large
        prints where close‑up detail is unimportant or will be refined during post‑processing.
        <br><br>
        You can optimize layer height per model to balance speed and resolution, but effective tuning
        is model‑specific and may require iteration.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Boosting resolution</h2>
<p class="font18">
A lesser‑known fact: most printers have higher vertical than horizontal resolution. Lead screws
provide very precise Z‑axis positioning compared to belt‑driven XY axes. This allows excellent
vertical detail — one reason lithophanes print so well.<br><br>
This helps explain why the

design by aaskedall is popular with Star Wars fans; it retains impressive detail on many machines.
Other designers now leverage this property too.<br><br>
Lower layer heights slow printing and may increase service costs, but more layers at the same height
yield greater detail and smoother results.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Smoother surfaces</h2>
<p class="font18">
Another benefit of smaller layers is smoother surfaces: layer lines are less pronounced. Larger
layers leave more visible lines and rougher surfaces.<br><br>
Reduce layer height for parts that need smooth motion or mating, like shafts or print‑in‑place
mechanisms. This increases detail but slows printing, so large parts at low heights take long and
can raise the risk of print failure.
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">What layer height should I choose?</h2>
<p class="font18">
If you need speed, choose a larger height. For artistic parts needing fine detail, go smaller.<br>
A good general‑purpose value is 0.2 mm. With a standard 0.4 mm nozzle, a rule of thumb is to use
about 50% of the nozzle diameter for layer height.
