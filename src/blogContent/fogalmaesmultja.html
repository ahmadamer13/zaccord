<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Introduction</h2>
<p class="font18">
        3D printing is an additive technology used to manufacture parts.<br>
        “Additive” means building physical objects by stacking and fusing layers instead of removing
        material or using molds. It’s typically fast to set up, has low tooling cost, and can create
        more complex geometries than many “traditional” methods, with a growing range of materials.
        It’s widely used in industry, especially for prototyping and lightweight structures.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">3D printing and additive manufacturing</h2>
<p class="font18">
        “3D printing” is often associated with makers, hobbyists, desktop printers, accessible technologies like FDM, and common materials like ABS and PLA. This is due to democratization from RepRap‑inspired, affordable machines like the original MakerBot and Ultimaker, which helped drive the 2009 boom.<br><br>
        Additive manufacturing builds objects by depositing and fusing 2D layers.<br>
        It has minimal setup time and cost, making it ideal for prototyping. Parts can be created
        quickly and even discarded after use. Nearly any geometry is possible — a key strength of 3D
        printing.<br><br>
        Key limitations: most parts are anisotropic or not fully dense, so they often lack the exact material properties of machined or molded parts. Variations in cooling/curing cause print‑to‑print differences, limiting consistency and repeatability.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">3D printing and rapid prototyping</h2>
<p class="font18">
        “Rapid prototyping” is another term historically used for 3D printing, dating back to its
        origins in the 1980s when techniques were suitable mainly for prototypes, not end‑use parts.
        <br><br>
        In recent years, 3D printing has become a great fit for many part types, while other
        processes also became cheaper and more accessible for prototyping.
</p>

<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">When was 3D printing invented?</h3>
<p class="font18">
  3D printing began as an idea to accelerate product development and prototyping. Although earlier
  patents existed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull" class="blueLink font18">Chuck Hull</a>
  is widely credited with inventing the 3D printer via his 1984 patent for the Stereolithography
  Apparatus (SLA).
  <br><br>

  Milestones:
</p>

<ul class="dul font18">
  <li>
    Despite Hull’s fame, multiple technologies were developed in parallel in the late 1980s, and
    several companies founded in that period played pivotal roles.
  </li>
  <li>
    1981: Hideo Kodama (Japan) filed the first patent for a device curing photopolymers with UV
    light to make models and prototypes; interest was low and the patent was dropped.
  </li>
  <li>
    1984: French inventors Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte, and Jean‑Claude André filed a patent
    for UV‑curing photopolymers. General Electric declined to pursue it due to perceived low
    business potential.
  </li>
  <li>
    1984: A few weeks after Le Méhauté, American inventor Charles “Chuck” Hull filed his own patent for a “device for producing three‑dimensional objects by stereolithography,” coining the term “SLA.”
  </li>
  <li>
    1987: Hull invented the STL file format and in the same year founded 3D Systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    1987: U.S. inventor Carl Deckard filed a patent for Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and co‑founded Desktop Manufacturing (DTM) Corp. (acquired by 3D Systems in 2001).
  </li>
  <li>
    1989: S. Scott Crump filed the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) patent and co‑founded Stratasys the same year.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Commercialization</h3>
<p class="font18">
        From the late 1980s to early 1990s, the industry rapidly commercialized. Early machines were large and expensive; manufacturers competed for industrial prototyping contracts across automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and consumer goods.
  <br><br>

  Milestones:
</p>

<ul class="dul font18">
  <li>
        1987: 3D Systems released the first commercial SLA printer, the “SLA‑1”.
  </li>
  <li>
        1992: Stratasys was granted the FDM patent and released its first FDM printer, the “3D Modeler”.
  </li>
  <li>
         1992: DTM released the first commercial SLS printer, the “Sinterstation 2000”.
  </li>
  <li>
         1994: Germany’s Electro Optical Systems (EOS) introduced the EOSINT M160, the first commercial metal 3D printer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font20">Democratization</h3>
<p class="font18">
        In the early 2000s, intense competition, advances in materials science, and expiring patents made 3D printing affordable to the masses. Manufacturing, once exclusive to heavy industry, reached the public imagination.
  <br><br>

  Milestones:
</p>

<ul class="dul font18">
  <li>
        2005: The open‑source RepRap project (Replicated Rapid Prototyper) launched aiming to create self‑replicating printers, sparking massive interest.
  </li>
  <li>
        2009: Key FDM patents expired and MakerBot released the “Cupcake CNC” desktop printer. Its parts were downloadable from Thingiverse, a site for sharing user‑created design files.
  </li>
  <li>
         2012: Formlabs launched the affordable “Form 1” SLA printer via a record‑breaking Kickstarter campaign, raising $2.95M. 3D Systems sued for patent infringement; the case settled in Formlabs’ favor.
  </li>
  <li>
        2013: Hubs launched as a peer‑to‑peer 3D printing service connecting buyers with machine owners, growing to the world’s largest platform with 50k+ hubs before focusing on custom manufacturing for business clients.
  </li>
  <li>
        2014: Expiration of key SLS patents spurred a wave of smaller, more affordable SLS printers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Maturity</h2>
<p class="font18">
        Since 2018, hype around 3D printing has largely faded from mass media, but commercial interest from businesses of all sizes has never been higher. Today, thousands of companies build printers and offer services leveraging 3D printing technologies.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Subtractive manufacturing</h2>
<p class="font18">
        Subtractive manufacturing, such as milling and turning, creates objects by removing material from a solid block, often called a “stock”.
        <br><br>
        Almost any material can be machined in some way, so it’s widely used. Because the process can be tightly controlled, it produces accurate parts with high repeatability. Most designs require CAM to generate toolpaths and enable efficient material removal, which increases setup time and cost — but for many designs, it’s the most cost‑effective manufacturing method.
        <br><br>
        Its main limitation is tool access: the cutter must reach every surface to remove material, which restricts design complexity. Although 5‑axis machines overcome some limits, complex parts still require re‑fixturing during machining, adding time and cost. Subtractive methods are also wasteful because significant material may be removed to achieve the final geometry.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Formative manufacturing</h2>
<p class="font18">
        Formative manufacturing, such as injection molding and pressing, creates objects by shaping materials using heat and/or pressure.
        <br><br>
        These techniques reduce cost per part in volume, but have high setup costs due to custom molds or tooling. Even so, they can produce parts from a wide range of materials (metals and plastics) with excellent repeatability, making them the most cost‑effective choice for high‑volume production.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">How do these methods compare?</h2>
<p class="font18">
        Manufacturing is complex, with too many dimensions to compare methods comprehensively. It’s nearly impossible to optimize everything at once across cost, speed, geometric complexity, materials, mechanical properties, surface finish, tolerances, and repeatability.
</p>
        In such complex situations, rules of thumb are more useful:
<ul class="dul font18">
  <li>
    Additive manufacturing is best for small quantities, complex geometries, and when speed is critical.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subtractive manufacturing is best for medium volumes, simpler geometries, tight tolerances, and hard materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Formative manufacturing is best for high‑volume production of identical parts.
  </li>
</ul>
