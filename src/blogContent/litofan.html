<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Introduction</h2>
<p class="font18">
  Learn the basics of lithophanes. A lithophane is a special art form from the past with a rich
  history. Today, anyone can make one from their own photos.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">What is a lithophane?</h2>
<p class="font18">
Its magic comes from how the image appears. Lithophanes are thin, curved or flat rectangular panels
with many fine details. These details only reveal themselves when light shines through from the back,
forming the image.
This unique reveal creates beautiful artwork with impressive detail. The way multiple elements work
together to reveal the hidden image is what makes lithophanes so interesting.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">How does a lithophane work?</h2>
<p class="font18">
Lithophanes are made from a thin material (historically porcelain) with varying thickness. Thicker
areas block more light than thinner ones, so the transmitted light varies in intensity.
This creates contrast that appears as different shades of gray. With fine, precise shaping, the
result can display lifelike images.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">3D‑printed lithophanes</h2>
<p class="font18">
For centuries, artists carved lithophanes from porcelain — a skill that required years of practice
and extreme precision to achieve high detail.<br><br>
With modern 3D printers, the possibilities have grown. 3D printing and lithophanes pair perfectly,
bringing this classic art to the digital age. Since we store photos digitally, nearly any picture can
be turned into a lithophane. Note that, like porcelain versions, 3D‑printed lithophanes are still
two‑dimensional reliefs.

<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">You’re close to making your own</h2>
<p class="font18">
Creating these striking images is more accessible than ever. With a 3D printer or a service and a
simple lithophane tool, you’re just a few clicks away. Many sites convert photos to STL files for
printing. On <a href="https://www.zaccord.com" class="blueLink font18">Zaccord</a> you can even order
without conversion — just upload your picture.
