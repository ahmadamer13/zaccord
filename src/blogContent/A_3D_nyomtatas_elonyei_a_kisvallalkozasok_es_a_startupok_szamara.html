<h2 class="gothamNormal fontNorm font22">Applications for entrepreneurs</h2>
<p class="font18">
Layer‑by‑layer fabrication enables complex designs that are difficult with conventional methods.
<br><br>
Key advantage: rapid, low‑cost prototyping to test design and function — with faster iteration versus
traditional model‑making.
<br><br>
Multiple prototypes can be created and tested across materials and environments.
<br><br>
Beyond prototyping, printing improves short‑run production efficiency for small batches.
<br><br>
Mass customization: deliver personalized products tailored to each customer’s needs.
<br><br>
For example, a small business specializing in custom jewelry can quickly and affordably produce bespoke pieces for clients using 3D printing. This level of customization helps small companies and startups stand out in crowded markets and deliver unique value.

Sustainability: additive processes minimize waste compared to subtractive methods.
<br><br>
Biodegradable polymers offer greener options for printed products.
<br><br>
Local, on‑demand production can create jobs and reduce reliance on long supply chains.
<br><br>
Beyond these use cases, several related technologies can combine with 3D printing to create more sustainable products. Researchers are exploring bioprinting with biological materials (cells, proteins), enabling products that are more biocompatible and potentially biodegradable — reducing waste and pollution.
