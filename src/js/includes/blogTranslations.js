    title: 'Is It Worth Investing in a 3D Printer?',
    categories: '3D Printing, Technology, 3D Printer',
    summary:
      'The technology of 3D printing and the number of possible designs and ideas are enormous, but buying a 3D printer is not worth it for everyone.\r\nMost people simply buy a printer and filament and think they can print anything, but when something goes wrong or breaks, they have no idea what to do.\r\n',

    title: 'Which Is Stronger? Resin vs Filament',
    categories: '3D Printing, Technology, Materials, Resin, Filament',
    summary:
      'The most frequently discussed topics relate to the quality, material cost, and printing time of printed models.\r\nSometimes we need to print an object that requires specific structural properties such as tensile strength and impact resistance, and we need to find out whether resin-printed parts are stronger or weaker than filament-printed ones.\r\n',

    title: '3D Printing and Its History',
    categories: '3D Printing, Technologies, History, Additive Manufacturing, Subtractive Manufacturing, Formative Manufacturing',
    summary:
      '3D printing is an additive technology used to produce parts. The term “additive” refers to the fact that physical objects are made without a material block or mold — instead, the printer builds up layers of material and fuses them together. It is typically fast, has low setup costs, and can create more complex geometries than traditional technologies, with an ever-growing list of materials. It is widely used in engineering, especially for making prototypes and lightweight designs.',

    title: 'The Role of Layer Height in 3D Printing',
    categories: '3D Printing, Technology, 3D Printer, Layer Height, Surface',
    summary:
      'Layer height in 3D printing is a simple setting that affects the printing speed and the level of detail of the model you want to print; it also impacts its durability, strength, and appearance.\r\nWhat and Why\r\nLayer height is exactly what it sounds like: the precise height of each layer of plastic extruded or cured by the 3D printer. This setting is controlled through slicing software and has much more influence on the final print than you might think at first glance. Properly adjusted layer height can significantly affect print quality.',

    title: 'Best Websites to Find Low-Poly Models',
    categories: '3D Printing, Online, Models, Low-Poly',
    summary:
      'Before listing the best low-poly 3D model sources, let’s see what “low-poly” actually means.\r\nThe term “poly” comes from “polygon.” A polygon is a 2D shape made up of straight lines and angles. When we combine several polygons, we can create recognizable 3D shapes.\r\n',
